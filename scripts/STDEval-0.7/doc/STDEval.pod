=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<STDEval.pl -e ecffile -r rttmfile -s stdfile -t termfile [-F fthresh] [-S sthresh] [-I name] [-E] [-C [filename]] [-a [filename]] [-O [filename]] [-o [filename]] [-d filename] [-D filename] [-H folder] [-Q folder] [-q attribute] [-w] [-T [set_name:]termid[,termid[, ...]]] [-Y [set_name:]sourcetype[,sourcetype[, ...]]] [-N file/channel[,file/channel[, ...]]] [-A] [-c cachefile] [-k value] [-K value] [-P] [-n value] [-p value]>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Evaluation Toolkit (STDEval) Software. Develop standard technology evaluation tools and administer the open evaluation of Spoken Term Detection technologies.

=head1 USAGE

The release contains test files and example files in the test_suite
directory.  The 'test2.*' files comprise a complete set of input files
supplied as an example usage of the evaluation tool.  The following
command generates two reports, 'example.occ.txt' and
'example.ali.txt'.  A DET curve is also produced in the example.det.*
files which can be used with the GNUPLOT program to render the graph.
The -c option writes intermediate information to so that subsequent
executions can avoid searching the RTTM file for term occurences.

    perl -I src ./src/STDEval.pl -e test_suite/test2.ecf.xml \
	-r test_suite/test2.rttm -s test_suite/test2.stdlist.xml \
	-t test_suite/test2.tlist.xml -A -o example.occ.txt \
        -a example.ali.txt -d example.det -c example.cache

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<Required file arguments:>

=over

=item B<-e>, B<--ecffile>

The ECF file name.

The STDList filename.

=item B<-t>, B<--termfile>

The TermList filename.

=back

=item B<Find options:>

=over

=item B<-F>, B<--Find-threshold> <thresh>

The <thresh> value represents the maximum time gap in seconds between two words in order to consider the two words to be part of a term when searching the RTTM file for reference term occurences. (default: 0.5).

=item B<-S>, B<--Similarity-threshold> <thresh>

The <thresh> value represents the maximum time distance between the temporal extent of the reference term and the mid point of system's detected term for the two to be considered a pair of potentially aligned terms. (default: 0.5).

=back

=item B<Filter options:>

=over

=item B<-E>, B<--ECF-filtering>

System and reference terms must be in the ECF segments (default: off).

=item B<-T>, B<--Term> [<set_name>:]<termid>[,<termid>[, ...]]

Only the <termid> or the list of <termid> (separated by ',') will be displayed in the Conditional Occurence Report and Conditional DET Curve. An name can be given to the set by specifying <set_name> (<termid> can be a regular expression).

=item B<-Y>, B<--YSourcetype> [<set_name>:]<type>[,<type>[, ...]]

Only the <type> or the list of <type> (separated by ',') will be displayed in the Conditional Occurence Report and Conditional DET Curve. An name can be given to the set by specifying <set_name> (<type> can be a regular expression).

=item B<-N>, B<--Namefile> <file/channel>[,<file/channel>[, ...]]

Only the <file> and <channel> or the list of <file> and <channel> (separated by ',') will be displayed in the Occurence Report and DET Curve (<file> and <channel> can be regular expressions).

=item B<-q>, B<--query> <name_attribute>

Populate the Conditional Reports with set of terms identified by <name_attribute> in the the term list's 'terminfo' tags.

=item B<-w>, B<--words-oov>

Generate a Conditional Report sorted by terms that are Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) for the system.

=back

=item B<Report options:>

=over

=item B<-a>, B<--align-report> <filename>

Output the Alignment Report. Filename is optional, if not specified, it displays in the STDOUT.

=item B<-o>, B<--occurrence-report> <filename>

Output the Occurence Report. Filename is optional, if not specified, it displays in the STDOUT.

=item B<-O>, B<--Occurrence-conditionalreport> <filename>

Output the Conditional Occurence Report. Filename is optional, if not specified, it displays in the STDOUT.

=item B<-d>, B<--det-curve> <filename>

Output the Conditional DET Curve.

=item B<-D>, B<--DET-conditional-curve> <filename>

Output the Conditional DET Curve.

=item B<-P>, B<--Pooled-DETs>

Produce term occurrence DET Curves instead of 'Term Weighted' DETs. '-d' and '-D' must still be used to specify the file names for the DET plots.

=item B<-C>, B<--CSV> <filename>

Output the CSV Report.

=item B<-H>, B<--HTML> <folder>

Output the Occurrence HTML Report.

=item B<-Q>, B<--QHTML> <folder>

Output the Conditional Occurrence HTML Report.

=item B<-A>, B<--All-display>

Add an additional column in the Occurence report containing the overall statistics for every term (default: off).

=item B<-k>, B<--koefcorrect> <value>

Value for correct (C).

=item B<-K>, B<--Koefincorrect> <value>

Value for incorrect (V).

=item B<-n>, B<--number-trials-per-sec> <value>

The number of trials per second (default: 1).

=item B<-p>, B<--prob-of-term> <value>

The probability of a term (default: 0.0001).

=item B<-I>, B<--ID-System> <name>

Overwrites the name of the STD system.

=back

=item B<Other options:>

=over

=item B<-c>, B<--cache-find> <filename>

Use the caching file for finding occurrences. If the file does not exist, it creates the cache during the search.

=item B<-h>, B<--help>

Display the help.

=item B<-v>, B<--version>

Display the version number.

=head1 BUGS

=head1 NOTES

=item B<filter options>

The filter options I<-T, --Term> and I<-Y, --YSourcetype> can be called several time on the command-line. Every time the option I<-T> occurs, it creates a set of term IDs. The name of the set can be specified by adding the name and ':' before listing the Term IDs. By the same way, sets can specify for the source types. By doing this, it will create sub-reports for every possible set combinaisons. Every sub-reports will be displayed as a DET Curve if I<-D> option has been called. In the same way, term sets represent rows and source type sets represent column in the Conditional Occurrence Report(I<-O> option).

For example, the combinaison of options: I<-T alpha:TERM-01,TERM-02 -T beta:TERM-03 -Y BNEWS+CTS:BNEWS,CTS -Y CONFMTG> generates in the conditional occurrence report 2 rows: alpha and beta, and 2 columns BNEWS+CTS, CONFMTG.
